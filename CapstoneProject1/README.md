# Predicting Customer Churn in the Telecom Industry
### Abstract
Client retention is one of the key drivers of profitability and longevity in many businesses. As such, it is a worthwhile endeavor to understand customer behavior and how it may be involved in helping companies better predict which customers are most likely to churn. This project performs a case study in churn by analyzing the customer data of a telecommunications company. Machine learning models in this study are optimized based on overall predictive accuracy. In addition, while the goal of the project is to better predict which clients at a given moment in time are more likely to churn, survival analysis will also be performed and discussed, so that the client can have an idea of how likely a customer is to churn in the future.

### Folder contents 
1) **Detailed Final Report**: This file contains several sections outlining the steps taken to complete the analysis for this project. It includes insights learned from the process, visualizations from the data and applicable business recommendations. Can be accessed in either [.docx](https://github.com/wladykam/SpringboardTest/blob/master/CapstoneProject1/CapstoneProject1FinalReport.docx) or [.pdf](https://github.com/wladykam/SpringboardTest/blob/master/CapstoneProject1/CapstoneProject1FinalReport.pdf) formats 
2) **Slide Deck**: The slide deck is accompanying material for the final report and would be used in a presentation setting. It is a more condensed version of the final report and also contains visualizations from the code. It can be found in [.pptx](https://github.com/wladykam/SpringboardTest/blob/master/CapstoneProject1/CapstoneProject1SlideDeck.pptx) or [.pdf](https://github.com/wladykam/SpringboardTest/blob/master/CapstoneProject1/CapstoneProject1SlideDeck.pdf) formats
3) **Code**: Code used for generating visualizations and performing analysis was generated in Python version 3.6.10 and can be found in eiter a [.py](https://github.com/wladykam/SpringboardTest/blob/master/CapstoneProject1/CapstoneProject1FinalCode.py ) or [.ipynb](https://github.com/wladykam/SpringboardTest/blob/master/CapstoneProject1/CapstoneCodeNotebook.ipynb) file 
4) **Dataset**: Original CSV file downloaded from kaggle stored [here](https://github.com/wladykam/SpringboardTest/blob/master/CapstoneProject1/telcom_data.csv)  
5) **images folder**: Contains saved images generated from Python code used in either the final report, the slide deck, EDA subsection or a combination of these and can be found by clicking [here](https://github.com/wladykam/SpringboardTest/tree/master/CapstoneProject1/images)
6) **PrelimMaterial folder**: Contains subtasks completed to help aid in the development of the final project. Components are CapstoneProject1_TelcomCustChurn.py, which is the full code file used before adding the condensed, final code in Section 3 above, DataStoryCapstone1.ipynb, which focuses on the EDA portion of this project, and MLAnalysisResults.docx which was a preliminary gathering of thoughts and ideas to aid in writing the Machine Learning section in the final report. This folder and these components can be found [here](https://github.com/wladykam/SpringboardTest/tree/master/CapstoneProject1/PrelimMaterial)
7) **.ipynb_checkpoints folder**: Contains saved checkpoints for .ipynb notebooks found in the CapstoneProject1 master [folder](https://github.com/wladykam/SpringboardTest/tree/master/CapstoneProject1/.ipynb_checkpoints)

**Most important files are contained in Sections 1, 2 and 3 above**
