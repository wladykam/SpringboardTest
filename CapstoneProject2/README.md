# Forecasting Realized Volatility: An Exploration of Predictive Models
### Abstract
Quantifying volatility and the inherent risk created from volatility is crucial for many industry professionals within the field of finance. Having better realized 
volatility forecasts can help asset managers more efficiently allocate assets and in turn, help clients meet their investment goals. In other areas of finance, 
traders will trade volatility directly; the need for accurate volatility forecasts is quite straightforward in this scenario. On an even broader level, retail 
clients can benefit from volatility forecasts by being able to more intelligently overlay income strategies such as call overwriting. No matter the use case, volatility
forecasts stand to benefit a large number of industry professionals and it is the goal of this project to introduce various methods for forecasting realized volatility by
starting with a case study of the S&P 500 Index ETF, SPY.

### Folder contents 
1) **Detailed Final Report**: The final report is a detailed write up explaining all major steps required to complete this project and relevant takeaways from each section.
The bulk of the material discusses models used and performance, but there are also other supplemental sections, such as an introduction, description of the dataset, important
insights from Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) as well as future work and conclusion sections. This can be accessed in either [.docx]
(https://github.com/wladykam/SpringboardTest/blob/master/CapstoneProject2/CapstoneProject2FinalReport) or [.pdf]

2) **Slide Deck**: The slide deck is accompanying material for the final report and would be used in a presentation setting. It is a more condensed version of the final report 
and therefore all information found in the final report is not contained in the slide deck. It also contains visualizations from the code. It can be found in [.pptx]
(https://github.com/wladykam/SpringboardTest/blob/master/CapstoneProject2/CapstoneProject2SlideDeck.pptx) or [.pdf]
(https://github.com/wladykam/SpringboardTest/blob/master/CapstoneProject2/CapstoneProject2SlideDeck.pdf) formats
3) **Code**: Code used for generating visualizations and performing analysis was generated in Python version 3.7.4 and can be found in either a [.py]
(https://github.com/wladykam/SpringboardTest/blob/master/CapstoneProject2/CapstoneProject2FinalCode.py) or [.ipynb]
